GSF LEGACY Submodule

	This submodule comprises all of the GSF's deprecated components (classes, configuration files, etc...).

	Stable components belong in the CORE submodule ONLY.
	
	Components will be progressively added to this JAR in future releases, as soon as they get deprecated.
	
	Components that get deprecated (and added to the LEGACY jar) will be physically removed from the GSF's codebase / project in the next major release after deprecation occurs.
	
	Full backwards-compatibility is not guaranteed for deprecated components. In fact, in some exceptional cases, deprecated components and new features could be incompatible with each other.
